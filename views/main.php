      This May I will be graduating from CU Denver with a degree in
      computer science, and I'm ready to make the leap into a rewarding 
      career of solving complex problems and writing kick ass software.
      <br><br>
      I have worked on trading systems and government regulatory compliance
      applications for derivatives market broker dealers. I have done back-end
      and front-end development for a powerful social networking application
      used at hundreds of conferences and events around the world.
      <br><br>
      I maintain a 3.85 GPA. I have 1.5 years of development
      experience under my belt. And sometimes, when the stars align just
      right, I get to hangout with my friends.
