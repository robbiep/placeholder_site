      I'll be graduating from CU Denver in May 2014, and I'm very
      excited to make the leap into a rewarding career of solving complex
      problems and writing kick ass software.
      <br><br>
      I have worked on trading systems and government regulatory compliance
      applications for derivatives market broker dealers. I have done back-end
      and front-end development for a powerful social networking application
      used at 100s of conferences and events around the world.
      <br><br>
      I maintain a 3.85 GPA. I'm currently employed, with 1.5 years development
      experience under my belt. And sometimes, when the stars align just
      right, I get a chance to go snowboarding or even hangout with my friends
      too.
