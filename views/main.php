      <h1>Hello, I'm Robbie Perlstein.</h1>
    </div>
      <p>I write code in archaic languages like Perl.</p>
      <p>I used to write archaic languages like Java and C++.</p>
      <p>I also used to write sexy new languages like Ruby (on Rails).</p>
      <p>Language doesn't matter.</p>
      <p>Attitude is the only thing that does.</p>
      <p>More important than attitude is aptitude for success.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I constantly aim to add value to all activities I participate in.
         This takes the form of joining the business discussion, reviewing
         architectural decisions within the code, and most importantly a constant barrage of humor (or at least attempts to be funny).
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>I'm eager to hear what you have to say, so let's chat!</p>
