I recently migrated hosts from Dreamhost to Digital Ocean, because of easy, affordable KVM running on SSDs, rather than Dreamhost's VZ running on spinning disks.

  <p>This is going to be a Ruby 2 on Rails 4 application, using Angular.js and Foundation. The main components will be a blog, an articles section, a projects section, and an about/contact area. The purpose is to <b>learn</b> more *nix, system administration and managing a server, Rails, Angular, etc. It will also serve as my resume. Finally, it is a place where I can do things that I like to do.</p>
  <p>I will try my best to document anything relevant, and try my best ot make things not suck. "Not suck" is a relative term though...</p>
